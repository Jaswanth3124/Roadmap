        <h1>C++ Programming Language Tutorial</h1>
    <p>Last Updated: 10 Jun, 2024</p>
    <p>C++ is the most used and most popular programming language developed by Bjarne Stroustrup. It is a high-level and object-oriented programming language that allows developers to write clean and efficient code for large applications, software development, game development, and operating system programming. C++ expands on the features of the C programming language by incorporating Object Oriented Programming (OOPs) concepts.</p>
    <p>This C++ Tutorial will cover all the basic to advanced topics of C++, including C++ basics, C++ functions, C++ classes, OOPs, and STL concepts.</p>

    <h1>Why Learn C++?</h1>
    <ul class="strong">
        <li>C++ is one of the most used and popular programming languages.</li>
        <li>C++ is used in making operating systems, embedded systems, and Graphical User Interfaces.</li>
        <li>It is an object-oriented programming language that implements all the OOPs concepts such as Abstraction, Encapsulation, and Inheritance, providing a clear structure to programs and allowing code to be reused, lowering development costs, and enhancing security.</li>
        <li>It is portable and can be used to create applications that can be adapted to multiple platforms.</li>
        <li>C++ is easy to learn, making it a suitable choice as your first programming language.</li>
        <li>It facilitates an easy transition for programmers to C++ because its syntax is similar to C, Java, and C#.</li>
    </ul>
