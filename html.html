        <h1>What is HTML?</h1>
    <p>HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It is the standard language used to create and design web pages on the internet. It was introduced by Tim Berners-Lee in 1991 at CERN as a simple markup language. Since then, it has evolved through versions from HTML 2.0 to HTML5 (the latest 2024 version).</p>
    <p>HTML is a combination of Hypertext and Markup language. Hypertext defines the link between the web pages and Markup language defines the text document within the tag.</p>
    <h1>Why Learn HTML?</h1>
    <ul class="strong">
        <li><strong>Web Structure Foundation:</strong> HTML provides the fundamental skeleton of every web page. It tells browsers how to display text, images, links, videos, and other elements.</li>
        <li><strong>Ease of Use:</strong> HTML is renowned for its beginner-friendliness. Its straightforward tags and syntax make it a great place to start your web development journey.</li>
        <li><strong>Gateway to Web Development:</strong> Mastering HTML is the first step toward learning more complex web technologies like CSS (for styling) and JavaScript (for interactivity).</li>
        <li><strong>Diverse Applications:</strong> It empowers you to build websites, email templates, newsletters, and much more.</li>
        <li><strong>Creative Expression:</strong> Allows you to bring your ideas to life online, fostering a fun outlet for creativity and design.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Here are all the important concepts covered in HTML. After completing this tutorial, youâ€™ll have a basic understanding of HTML and be ready for the next stage of web development, CSS.</p>
